# se_training
SE training. With the rapid evolution of software technology, including frameworks, testing and deployment tools, there is a need for a repository of highquality software engineering resources. Students need access to tutorials and
videos that they can use to self-learn. The resources should be better organised than just performing a search on Google. The resources should be lightly
controlled to ensure inappropriate material does not appear, be easy to search,
and allow for comments on the effectiveness of the learning materials.
The goal of the project is to build a repository of learning resources for
software students to self-learn about important emerging technologies such as
programming frameworks, testing tools, and deployment tools. Students need
access to videos and tutorials that explain new tools and languages clearly. An
example is a tutorial on React or a step-by-step account on installing Docker.
